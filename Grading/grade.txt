Hello! This is TODO grading your A2.

Your total score is TODO / 50

The point breakdown is given in the sections below, corresponding to the
rubric given on the A2 handout.

==============================
Hours and submission mechanics
==============================
TODO / 1 point:
Hours spent appear as a lone integer in hours.txt

======================
Vocab.java Correctness
======================
Your Vocab.java was tested with two different inputs from standard input
and from files given as command line arguments. You can see the output of these
test cases in vocab_out.txt.  The output of my solution code on these test
cases is as follows. I've run the code using the -q flag, which tells Gradle to
keep quiet:

standard input 1:
14 20

standard input 2:
1955 8060

1 command line arg:
14 20

2 command line args:
14 20
1955 8060


Your scores:

TODO / 3 points:
Vocab prints the unique and total counts of words from standard input

TODO / 3 points:
 Vocab prints the unique and total counts of words from each command-line argument

==========
Efficiency
==========

TODO / 5 points:
avlInsert maintains O(log n) performance by keeping track of node heights and updating them as necessary

TODO / 5 points:
Vocab processes a document with n words in O(n log n) time

=====
Style
=====

Inadequate commenting:
    author, date and purpose should appear in a comment at the top of each file you make changes to
    methods you introduce should be accompanied by a precise specification
    non-obvious code sections should be explained in comments

Poor style:
    indentation should be consistent
    each method should be written as concisely and clearly as possible
    methods should not be too long - use private helper methods
    code should not be cryptic and terse
    variable and function names should be informative


============
Enhancements
============

TODO / 2 points:
remove correctly removes a node from the tree

TODO / 1 point:
remove maintains AVL balance

TODO / 1 point:
The tree tracks a count for each node, inserting or incrementing on insertion and decrementing or removing on removal.

TODO / 1 point:
Sliding window vocabulary tracking is implemented.


====================
AVL.java Correctness
====================

All of the AVL correctness rubric items are graded by unit testing. The output
of gradle test is shown in grading_outputs/unittests.txt. You earn 1.33 points
per unit test, rounded up to the next larger integer.

Total AVL correctness score:
TODO / 28
